- Try the seero.py haiku approach for drum sounds
  - basic formula: split @ zero crossings, then shuffle and selectively repeat small pockets
  - just do it to moments, preserve generally the original sound

## Long-form version notes (a suite mix)

identify as many qualities as possible as gamut

give it a flow that makes sense over about 20 minutes

sections:

  - isolate and magnify timbres
    - hoover synth drones for intro
    - vocal drones become rhythms?
      - phoneme beats
    - the click bass
    - vocoder vox
    - modulated triangle lead arp voice
    - dry electronic drums... points / particles / clusters
      - granular section / layer
    - arp guitar
    - distant talking?
  - focus on rhythm
    - clave synth
    - 1 / 1 / 1 / 1
    - triplets over quarters (voice esp)
  - re-set melody over new harmony
    - the longer vocal melodies
    - arp counterpoint that leans into substitution chords...
    - tracking common tones with drones throughout...
